My name is **Hong-Ye Hu(扈鸿业)**. I am a physics PhD candidate at University of California, San Diego. 
I am currently working on the interface between **quantum information**, **many-body physics** and **machine learning**. 

I am actively seeking for **postdoc position that will start in 2022**, focus on **Quantum information, quantum computation, and machine learning**

(Fun fact) My Erdos Number is 3 (==>Lei Wang==>Gergely Harcos==>Paul Erdos)

Especially, I am currently working on the following topics:
* **Quantum information & Machine learning**:
  - Hamiltonian-driven shadow tomography of quantum states. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10132.pdf), [Blog](https://github.com/hongyehu/Hamiltonian-driven-shadow-tomography-page)
  - Quantum state tomography using neural networks. [Code](https://github.com/hongyehu/Machine_Learning_Quantum_State_Tomography)
  - Resonant quantum search with monitor qubits. [Paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0256-307X/37/5/050304/meta) Prof. Frank Wilczek also gave a short presentation. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lnlt7NlLL4)
  - Variational quantum circuits.
* **Machine learning & Physics**:
  - Neural network renormalization group to Holographic mapping, and lattice field theory simulation. [Paper](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.023369)
  - Apply renormalization group to real data, like human face. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.00029.pdf),[Code](https://github.com/hongyehu/RG-Flow)
  - Neural ODE and holographic QCD. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00712.pdf)
* **Condensed matter physics**:
  - Topological and symmetry-enriched random quantum critical points. **PRB Letter, Editor's Suggestion** [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02285.pdf),[Code](https://github.com/hongyehu/SBRG)
  - Detecting confinement-deconfinement phase transition in disorder toric code using spectrum bifurcation renormalization group. (in preparation)
  - Quantum Magnetism in Wannier-Obstructed Mott Insulators. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01439.pdf)
  - Phase-fluctuation Induced Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking Normal State. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06158)
