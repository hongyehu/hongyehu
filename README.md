### Hi there 
My name is Hong-Ye Hu(æ‰ˆé¸¿ä¸š). I am a physics PhD candidate at University of California, San Diego. 
I am currently working on the interface between **physics** and **machine learning**. 
Especially, I am currently working on the following topics:
* **Unsupervised learning**:
  - Flow-based generative models, energy-based models, auto-regressive models
  - Representation learning/disentangle representation
  - Neural ODE/PDE
  - RNN, attention-based RNN, and Natural Language Process
* **Renormalization group** in machine learning and multi-scale representations
* Physics:
  - **Efficient sampling** in energy models (lattice models, field theory models)
  - Machine learning & AdS/CFT duality 
  - **Quantum information & AI**: Quantum state tomography, variational quantum circuits
  - AI scientists 


:book: Education:
* **2012-2016** Peking University, Department of Physics. Advisor: Prof. Biao Wu
* **2018-2022(Expected)** University of California, San Diego, Department of Physics. Advisor: Prof. Yi-Zhuang You.

**Will actively seek for postdoc position in 2021 summer, focus on Machine Learning, Representation Learning, and Physical Science**

I am open for collaborations if you share the same passion for combine science and machine learning.

ðŸ”­ On the physics side, I used to work on:
* Quantum adiabatic algorithms
* Disordered quantum spin systems and topological states

âš¡ Fun fact: This is a new account I will try to maintain!
