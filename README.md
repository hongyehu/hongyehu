### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Hong-Ye Hu(æ‰ˆé¸¿ä¸š). I am a physics PhD at University of California, San Diego. 
I am currently working on the interface between physics and machine learning. 
Especially, I am currently working on the following topics:
* Unsupervised learning:
  - Flow-based generative models, energy-based models, auto-regressive models
  - Representation learning/disentangle representation: beta-VAE, contrastive models
  - Neural ODE/PDE
* Neural symbolic regressions
* Renormalization group in machine learning and multi-scale representations
* Physics:
  - Efficient sampling in energy models (lattice models, field theory models)
  - Machine learning & AdS/CFT duality 
  - AI scientists

ðŸ˜„ I am open for collaborations if you share the same passion for combine science and machine learning.
